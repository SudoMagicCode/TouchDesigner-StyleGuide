While there are limits to a modular approach, it\u2019s well worth considering the larger implications around cultivating a forward focused temperament when building new systems. Every project will eventually come up against deadlines, changes orders, and the necessities of project delivery. To the best of our abilities, however, we might consider a tempered approach to thinking about how a particular element might be able to be used and re-used in future projects."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"To that end, clear organization and careful planning help facilitate this process. For the sake of a simple case study, let\u2019s for a moment consider instancing networks. For the uninitiated, instancing allows you to reuse a single piece of geometry once it\u2019s been passed to the GPU. This method of drawing geometry is significantly cheaper, computationally, than drawing additional copies of the geometry on the CPU. In principle, you only draw the geometry once, then create a transformation matrix for subsequent copies of the original geometry. The transformation of the copies is most efficiently done in CHOP channels, sometimes initially fed by a geometry converted to channel data."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"If we develop the transformation channels in the same network as the rendering system, we\u2019re able to quickly see what\u2019s happening in the process. This also allows for less complicated paths, in a network that is generally flatter. The trade off here is re-usability. This approach typically makes it more difficult to identify how to break apart a network for re-use. The alternative, would be to build the rendering engine as a separate directory from the networking focused on object transformation. It\u2019s difficult to say which is the \u201cbetter\u201d choice, as both have their merits. Rather, it\u2019s important to understand that one approach has a shorter potential shelf life."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This brings us to a larger question of organization \u2013 in what manner should one organize their network. While there aren\u2019t any hard and fast rules, it\u2019s worth considering how you might construct a network as specific to it\u2019s given role. In the example above, you might build a network that was focused on transformational information, while another was focused on texture\u2019s, and finally a network that was the rendering engine. This modular division creates more layers, but also allows for the reuse of any one of those elements \u2013 save just the texture building system, or the instances. This also creates space to consider how you might externalize those elements \u2013 in this respect a git history would allow the programmer to trace back through various iterations of one element while still preserving the current developments of another \u2013 keep all of your advances in texture building, but go back to an earlier transformation system \u2013 for example."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"If you\u2019re not yet sold on this idea, at the very least consider dividing up your network, spatially, into regions responsible for a given task.

When possible, it is essential that you avoid this kind of programming.
