For this very reason we\u2019ve landed on the explicit prefixing of unique node names in a TouchDesigner network with the operators\u2019 type. For example, a null TOP used as a background element might have the name \u201cnull_bg\u201d. While this makes for longer operator names, it also allows other programmers the opportunity to see, at a glance, what operators are in a given network or process. While this may initially feel cumbersome, this convention is ultimately about making your code as parse-able and readable for another programmer as possible.
